# Allstate

Code for Allstate Compeition on Kaggle.  I ran out of steam mid-compeition as work started to get busy
What we have here is an attempt to build a model from scratch, documented with each step.

Older code still here, but we start with 
First-Pass NN which is a quick first stab, no data exploration just a dirty neural net.
